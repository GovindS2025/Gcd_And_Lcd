# Gcd_And_Lcd

ðŸ”¹ Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.
	â€¢	Also called Highest Common Factor (HCF).
	â€¢	Example:â€¨GCD of 12 and 18 is 6, because 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 exactly.

ðŸ”¹ Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)
The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.
	â€¢	Example:â€¨LCM of 12 and 18 is 36, because 36 is the smallest number that both 12 and 18 divide into exactly.
